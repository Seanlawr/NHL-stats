# NHL-stats

This repository will be for collecting all pieces of a personal project on NHL statistics. The intention is to collect NHL player statistics from an online repository (probably Hockey-reference), clean the data using python, move the data over to Microsoft Power BI and make a dashboard of the data, and perhaps even in the fiuture incorporate some machine learning ideas.

Future intentions are to read in several years of players statistics, and both predict future points based on past points, and to also create a version of player style types like how the EA NHL video game classifies players (Two-Way, Sniper, etc.).
